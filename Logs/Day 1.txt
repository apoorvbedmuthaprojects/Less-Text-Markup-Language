First thing to consider are doctype declarations in html,they are a pain to remember,The most common and reliable doctype to use is 

<!DOCTYPE html>

hence we will keep it as default i.e. it will be implemented if no doctype is specified.
though the user must have a functionality to specify which doctype should he use,hence he can do it using the following syntax

doctype:5 

which can be used for specifying HTML5 doctype i.e. <!DOCTYPE html>

similarly,
for HTML 4.01 Strict user can use 

doctype:4Strict

for HTML 4.01 Transitional user can use 

doctype:4Trans

for HTML 4.01 Frameset user can use 

doctype:4Frameset

for XHTML 1.0 Strict user can use 

doctype:XStrict

for XHTML 1.0 Transitional user can use 

doctype:XTrans

for XHTML 1.0 Frameset user can use 

doctype:XFrameset

for XHTML 1.1 - DTD user can use 

doctype:XDtd

for XHTML Basic 1.1 user can use 

doctype:XBasic


for MathML 2.0 - DTD user can use 

doctype:Math2Dtd

for MathML 1.01 - DTD user can use 

doctype:Math1Dtd

for XHTML + MathML + SVG - DTD user can use 

doctype:Compound
