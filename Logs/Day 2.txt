**Project LTML**
Day 2 - 14 May 2021

Since the aim is to help developer code with as less code as possible and 
make the whole experience easy and faster.
We need to eliminate all the redundant structuring
for e.g:

<html>
    <head>
        <title>
        </title>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>

is going to be in your html file everytime so why should you be complied to write it everytime,
Hence, LTML does that for you

Let me show you with an example:

The below code in LTML

title:Demo Ltml Project

will be equivalent to the below code in HTML:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>
            Demo Ltml Project
        </title>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>

in this way developer only needs to focus on what's actually important.
